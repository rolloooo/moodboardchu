# MoodBoard — Digital Synesthesia Interface

A hyper-stylized digital dashboard designed to map human emotions onto a cyberpunk operating system. More than a mood tracker, it's a sensory environment control deck, turning emotional input into visual and auditory ASMR feedback.

## Core Features

### 🧠 Mood Sync Protocol
* **Mood Picker:** Select from over 25 nuanced mood states (Happy, Nostalgic, Chaotic, Digital Zen, etc.).
* **Temporal Logging:** Track recent mood entries in the System Log panel with time-sync indicators.
* **ASMR Feedback:** Each mood selection triggers a synthetic sound and visual loading animation.

### 🎛️ The Control Deck (Fidget/ASMR Toys)
Manipulate the application's entire visual environment in real-time using functional interface switches and sliders:

| Control Name | Function | Aesthetic Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **REALITY\_FILTER** | Toggles RGB/CRT Scanline Overlay. | Distorts the UI with a classic video distortion effect. |
| **DREAM\_LOGIC** | Toggles Color Inversion Mode. | Flips the entire color scheme to negative (Black to White/Green to Pink). |
| **BINAURAL\_BEATS** | Toggles System Pulse Animation. | Adds a slow, rhythmic **breathing** scale effect to the main panels. |
| **ALPHA\_WAVES** | Controls Panel Blur Intensity. | Adjusts the 'frosted glass' (backdrop-blur) effect on all UI panels. |
| **NOISE\_GATE** | Controls Film Grain Opacity. | Increases or decreases the static noise/grain layer across the viewport. |
| **Tactile Matrix** | Interactive Hover Grid. | Provides satisfying visual feedback on mouse movement. |

### 📟 Cyberpunk Aesthetics
* Triple-panel layout with dedicated System Status, Control Deck, and Main Interface areas.
* Heavy use of mono fonts, glow effects, neon color palettes (Green/Pink/Purple).
* Glitch and loading animations for a high-fidelity retro digital feel.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend Framework:** Next.js / React
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (heavily customized with utility classes and custom animations/keyframes defined locally for immediate function).
* **Animation:** Standard CSS Keyframes (for maximum visual fidelity and ASMR effects).
* **Deployment:** Vercel and Netlify
