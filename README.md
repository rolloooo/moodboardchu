# MoodBoard — Digital Synesthesia Sandbox

MoodBoard is a stylized emotional interface that transforms mood selection into reactive visuals, kanji expression, and ASMR-inspired micro-animations. It aims to feel like a playful digital OS module for expressing and exploring emotion through UI.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

MoodBoard draws inspiration from:
- **Retro-digital OS aesthetics** (Matrix, cyberpunk terminals)
- **Japanese minimalism** (Kanji symbolism, negative space)
- **Fidget culture** (ASMR interactions, tactile feedback)
- **Glassmorphism** (Blur effects, layered transparency)
- **Generative art** (Procedural textures, dynamic gradients)

A small, evolving experiment in **emotion-driven interface design** that treats feelings as data to be visualized, manipulated, and explored through playful digital toys.
